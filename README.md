# cmocking
A small sample of testing and mocking in C++

A brief experiment in unit testing in C++. 

Created as an example of how dependency injection can make testing easier. Specifically, I crafted it such that cin and
cout streams can be replaced when testing with string streams such that we can guarantee input and test output.
